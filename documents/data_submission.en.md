### Submitting Your RDF Dataset

RDF Portal welcomes submissions of RDF datasets in the life sciences. Submissions are restricted to RDFized knowledge bases relevant to life science research. Please note that RDF representing only raw measurement data (e.g., direct outputs from experimental instruments) is not eligible for submission.

When preparing a submission, contributors are asked to provide not only the RDF files but also a set of configuration files in YAML format, following the specifications of RDF-config. These configuration files are essential to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and proper integration of datasets into the portal.

All submitted datasets undergo a quality review conducted by the RDF Portal team at DBCLS. The review evaluates whether the dataset complies with the DBCLS Guidelines for RDFizing Databases. Only datasets that successfully pass this review are officially registered and published in the portal. If issues are identified during the review, contributors may be asked to revise their data. In cases where revisions are not made, the dataset may not be accepted for registration. This process ensures that RDF Portal maintains a collection of high-quality, semantically consistent, and interoperable RDF datasets.

If you are interested in submitting your RDF dataset for review, please contact us via the following form:<br>

### Overview

RDF Portal is a platform that brings together diverse life science data in a standardized, globally recognized format. By linking information on genes, proteins, diseases, compounds, and more across multiple databases, it enables users to search, connect, and utilize trusted data more effectively. The portal provides an environment where reliable datasets can be accessed not only by specialists but also by a broad range of communities interested in life science data.

### About RDF Portal

RDF Portal is a dedicated gateway for accessing and integrating life science resources represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In modern biomedical and life science research, essential knowledge is dispersed across heterogeneous databases—spanning genomic, proteomic, metabolic, disease, chemical, and scholarly resources—each differing in data format, schema, and terminology. These discrepancies pose significant obstacles to integrative data analysis and computational knowledge discovery.

RDF provides a unifying, machine-readable model based on subject–predicate–object triples, enabling structural consistency across disparate datasets. By assigning globally resolvable URIs, RDF supports precise data identification and semantic interoperability among independent resources. This facilitates the construction of interoperable knowledge graphs, in which entities such as genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, and compounds are explicitly connected, allowing researchers to traverse and analyze complex biological networks.

The incorporation of community-driven ontologies (e.g., Gene Ontology, ChEBI, Disease Ontology) and controlled vocabularies provides semantic harmonization, reduces terminological ambiguity, and enables logical inference. When combined with SPARQL, RDF empowers ontology-driven, machine-executable queries that extend beyond text matching to enable semantic search, automated reasoning, and hypothesis generation. In this way, RDF Portal serves not only as a repository of RDF datasets but also as an infrastructure for computable knowledge integration, cross-domain data reuse, and advanced biomedical informatics.

All RDF datasets submitted to RDF Portal undergo a quality review by DBCLS to ensure compliance with the DBCLS RDF Guidelines. Only datasets that pass this review are registered and published through the portal. This process guarantees a certain level of quality assurance, enabling the accumulation of reliable, semantically interoperable RDF data for the research community.

Importantly, the RDF datasets stored in RDF Portal are designed to be consistent with the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). By curating and disseminating FAIR-compliant RDF datasets, RDF Portal contributes to the broader landscape of international Open Science, promoting transparency, reusability, and global collaboration in life science research.

### History

RDF Portal was originally developed in parallel with the Integrated Database Project of the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Its initial mission was to serve as a hosting platform for RDF datasets generated by projects funded under the integration program. In this early phase, the contents of the portal were largely limited to RDF data directly submitted by those projects.

Over time, the portal expanded its scope by actively incorporating diverse RDF datasets openly available worldwide. This evolution marked a shift from a submission-based repository to a comprehensive, globally oriented hub for RDF-based resources, reflecting the increasing importance of Linked Open Data and semantic integration in biomedical research.

Since 2022, the stewardship of RDF Portal has transitioned from NBDC to the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS). Under DBCLS, the portal continues to be developed as a sustainable, community-oriented infrastructure that promotes semantic data integration, supports FAIR-compliant data dissemination, and advances international Open Science by enabling federated access, reuse, and knowledge discovery across the life sciences.
